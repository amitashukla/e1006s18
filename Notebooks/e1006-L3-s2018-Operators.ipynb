However, on September 23, 1999, communication with the spacecraft was lost as the spacecraft went into orbital insertion, due to ground-based computer software which produced output in non-SI units of pound (force)-seconds (lbf·s) instead of the SI units of newton-seconds (N·s) specified in the contract between NASA and Lockheed. The spacecraft encountered Mars on a trajectory that brought it too close to the planet, causing it to pass through the upper atmosphere and disintegrate.\" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Climate_Orbiter#Cause_of_failure)\n",

For that split second, the Therac-25 believed it was safe to proceed when, in fact, it wasn't.
